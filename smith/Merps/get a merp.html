<p>There are many ways to obtain a merp. The two most common methods of getting a merp are adopting and buying one from a pet store. In this course, you're going to learn the dos and donts of getting your first merp. So, follow along and make sure to read the entire page to be sure you know what you want.</p>
<h2>Adopting a Merp</h2>
<p>When adopting a merp you want to make sure that you go to a credible dealer, that sustainably fishes merps, you also want to make sure that you do your research on the merp that you are going to adopt. Some ways you can do this include: Going on the dealership's website or you can ask questions in person. Just make sure that you know exactly the type of merp you're getting, so that you know you will be pleased with it</p>

<h2>Buying a Merp from a Pet Store</h2>
<p>When buying a merp from a pet store, you want to make sure that it is a merp shop and not a generic pet store. If they sell cats, dogs, fish, hamsters and merps, that store is probably not reliable for merps. Merps require special attention on a daily and many of these pet stores are not able to supply them with that. Also, bigger chain pet stores normally overfish merps and deliver them in bad condition</p>
