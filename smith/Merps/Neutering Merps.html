<p>Neutering is something Dr. Smith is an expert at. Join us as he walks us through things to know and consider before getting your merp neutered.</p>

<h2>Why would someone want to neuter their merp?</h2>
<p>	Someone may want to neuter a merp to prevent violence because if a merp is not neutered it will most likely be violent towards other merps
and other species such as Bermudezes. It will also probably mate with anything it can get it's paws on. Neutering a merp will fix these problems so that
you can have a nice, sweet, calm merp.</p>

<h2>What should I consider before I get my merp neutered?</h2>
<p>Well, obviously if you are going to breed your merp then don't get it neutered, but some things that you want to consider before getting your merp neutered
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are you going to get your merp neutered? <br> I will neuter Merps and you can find out how to contact me on my bermudez page about neutering</li>
<li>How old is my merp? <br> If your merp is over 5 years old it's probably a little too late to get it neutered, but if you'd like you still can.</li>

<p>There are a lot of things to consider when neutering your merp that I won't even go into right now, but the most important thing to think about is
if you have other pets in the house. If you have other pets in the house you should most likely neuter your merp to prevent violence and breeding between
them. You can train a merp with some effort to not be violent to other pets but breeding is pretty hard to stop.</p>
