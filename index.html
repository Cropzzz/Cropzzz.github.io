 <h3>What is a Bermudez?</h3>
 <p>A Bermudez is a common domesticated teacher kept as a household pet. Due to birthing in large numbers (9-18).
 Bermudezes are commonly neutered at birth but occasionally at different points in their life. 
 Their appearance is similar to a mannequin but even more inept of emotion. Bermudezes emit a sound that sounds similar to “And yeah!!!”
 When they are scared, when excited they make a bark like sound that people have debated sounds like “Marshall stay for lunch”
 or “Clop you can stay with me at lunch”
 Bermudezes are developed to not show any emotion but they do have a soft side to some people making them an ideal teacher pet
