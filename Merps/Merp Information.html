<!--Add information about buying merps and getting them neutered, they dont get along with bermudezes-->
<h2>Getting your First Merp</h2>
<p>When getting your first merp there are a lot of things that should be taken into consideration such as where you are getting the merp from,
what materials you will need to care for your merp and if you have the funds to care for a merp.</p>
<p>		One of the first things you should be thinking about when getting a merp is where you're getting the merp from. You should only adopt
merps that have been sustainably fished and are above 2 weeks old. If they are below 2 weeks old they should not leave their parents care and you should
get the baby merp and it's parents.</p>
<p>		Another thing you have to consider when getting a merp is what products you will be using with it. This includes but is not limited to: a bed,
food dish, water dish, litter box, leash, collar and toys. Before getting your merp make sure you will have enough money to cover supplies and possibly 
even vet visits. Sometimes when adopting merps you will be provided with one free vet checkup, make sure that you do use this checkup so that you can
ensure that your merp is healthy and is ready to live a long happy life with you.</p>

<h2>Caring for your first merp</h2>

<p>Once you have your first merp it can be very chaotic if you do not know what you are doing. If you have a friend that has owned or has a merp you
could ask them for advice with raising your merp. Below you will find some of the necessities for caring for a merp. Be sure to check other sources as 
well so that you can ensure that you are ready to care for your merp once you get it. Caring for your merp can go anywhere from feeding and playing with
it to training it. Without further ado, lets get started</p>

<p>		When you first get your merp it is best to leave it locked in a small room with all of the necessities such as a litter box, food & water stations
and a bed. It is best to leave it alone for a little bit so it can get acquainted with it's environment. After you feel it is slightly comfortable,
you can go into the room and let it sniff your fingers and slowly start petting your merp. Make sure not to move too fast as that may frighten your merp.
Make sure that you also allow all of your other family members to see your merp so that the merp can become familiar with them aswell.</p>

<h2>Getting your merp neutered</h2>
<p>When you first get your merp you may notice that it is very violent, this is because it is not neutered. Unless you plan on breeding your merp, it is
best to get it neutered. You can find more information about neutering on our neutering page. Also please note that if you have any Bermudezes in your
house your merp probably not be afraid to cross-breed with it. Animals do not have laws so consensual breeding is not a concern to them so please make sure
that you keep your Bermudez safe from your merp.</p>
